Simple Address Book app built by Maddox and John for Flatiron school's Phase 1 project.

The address book contains functionality to add new contacts with their name, phone, email, photo, and address. The application can also delete contacts with the 'X' in the top right corner of 'Contact Info'. (Note: as of this build there is no confirmation notifcation and it is not possible to undo a delete!)

Bugs, feedback, and suggestions for improvement can be sent via Discord to @jphonxaya#4242 and @lovell#2598
